Now the site is live...
TODO: popper.min.js
TODO: add more example sites
TODO: contact form 7 - notification styling
TODO: clients section - use blog posts and summary on home page?
TODO: update date in blog post still showing even though overwrite function added
TODO: add back to top button to footer (or appears once scrolled past 'above the fold'?)
BUG: add in Social media icon links
TODO: add Twitter feed to footer
TODO: create all the theme variables properly 

Plan:

Install understrap
Create understrap child theme
Get Softing template styling and apply to site pages
Better to convert Softing markup to BS4 markup, that way scale down the size of all the css
So create a set of BS components, based on Softing styles

Create WP site from the above theme
